I'm not sure whether i have successfully created a ner branch, so i do it again and commit a new log.



1. it's difficult to use git.
2. make sure to add before commit. I can use git status to check my operations
3. i need to write instructions when i commit a change, it is of great significance.
4. git is such an useful tool for version control as i can easily switch back to previous version.
